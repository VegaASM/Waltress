Bug003: The very first instruction of any source *CANNOT* be a branch that uses a branch label. Its label will not be converted to a SIMM. Then Waltress will try to assemble the branch instruction as a regular instruction, which will result in a sscanf failure (invalid instruction).
Bug004: The checks to make sure Branch Labels use Capital Letters and/or Underscores fails. Then Waltress will try to assemble the branch instruction as a regular instruction, which will result in a sscanf failure (invalid instruction).
Bug007: Branch SIMMs must be in unsigned form or else certain conditional branches will have the wrong bit hint value assembled.
