How to Debug the Desktop App if desired. Linux Guide only.

Step 1: Install QEMU and GDB
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qemu-user qemu-user-static gdb-multiarch build-essential

Step 2: Run Waltress-DV with QEMU (process will stall, this is normal)
cd DV
qemu-ppc -g 1234 ./main

Step 3: While leaving Step 2's Terminal intact, open a different terminal in same directory and run this GDB command:
gdb-multiarch -q --nh \
  -ex 'set architecture ppc' \
  -ex 'file main' \
  -ex 'target remote localhost:1234' \
  -ex 'break main' \
  -ex continue \
  -ex 'layout split' \
  -ex 'layout regs'
  
Now you are ready to use GDB to step thru and debug Waltress-DV. Registers may not be available. If this is the case, issue 1 stepi command. You will now see the registers.

GDB quick guide (use Google for help with other commands):
stepi = step instruction
break *0xX = breakpoint at address, X = address (i.e. break *0x100008FC)
del X = delete breakpoint via its assigned number. whenever you set or hit a bp, GDB will show the BP's assigned number
continue = run program after hitting break point
quit = exits GDB and properly ends the QEMU emulation. Be sure to always quit GDB first before closing the qemu terminal
