First thing's First. Waltress is an alpha-type program. Meaning it's not ready for "production" usage. Bugs and weird errors will most likely occur. Do not rely on Waltress as your main Wii Gecko Code assembler. If Waltress ever reaches version 1.0.0, then it will be considered ready for production use.

At the moment, the only "nuisance" Waltress possesses is the IMM (Immediate) Value Format rules that must be followed. Be sure to read --IMM-Format-- further below.

===========

Features~
- Full support for 04, 06, C0, and C2 Gecko codetypes
- Yes, the blr is auto-added for you on C0 codes
- Uses a special header for Gecko codes. There's no need to select an option when assembling/disassembling. Just include the header at the very top of your file. See -Gecko-Header-Format- below for details.
- If there is a faulty instruction when assembling, Waltress will tell you which instruction it is (if multiple, Waltress only lists the top/first one)
- Checks all rA=/=r0 rules for all applicable load/store instructions
- Checks if NB in lswi does not cause rD's loaded bytes to spill into rA
- Checks for all valid SPR's for both mfspr and mtspr, note that the validity is only matched for the Wii Broadway chip
- Includes support for Broadway's rarely known chip ID SPR's
- When disassembling, clrlwi, clrrwi, rotlwi, rotlw, slwi, and srwi are used over their standard mnemonic forms.
- Anything that can be assembled can be disassembled and vice versa.

============

As mentioned earlier, Waltress is an alpha-type program. Therefore, it does not include some basic features you would expect. Those are...
- Branch labels are indeed supported, but have some restrictions (read -Branch-labels- below)
- Assembler directives not supported
- Immediate Values have some restrictions (read -IMM-format- below)
- Register alias's (i.e. sp, rtoc) not supported.

The above limitations may be fixed in the future, who knows.

Waltress supports all simplified mnemonics except for the following...

inslwi(.)
insrwi(.)
extlwi(.)
extrwi(.)
clrlslwi(.)
rotrwi(.)
la
twlt
twgt
tweq
twge
twle
twne

============

-Gecko-Header-Format-

The syntax for the Header is as follows...

!<codetype><24-bit address if applicable>

Example 04 header
!04565AAC

Example 06 header
!06565AAC

Example C2 header
!C2565AAC

Example C0 header
!C0

Just add the appropriate header to source.s/code.txt for your Gecko code to be assembled/disassembled correctly.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not place any notes/comments before the Gecko Header.

============

-IMM-Format-

Waltress does require some strict Immediate Value Formatting in regards to Hex vs Decimal for certain instructions. Here are all the restrictions~

No binary or octal usage.

All Branch SIMMs, if used, *must* be in Unsigned Capitalized Hex.

Lowercase Hex *CANNOT* be of negative connotation (i.e. -0xa is prohibited while -0xA is allowed)

IMM in mtfsfi(.) *must* be in Hex.

CRM field in mtcrf *must* be in Hex.

FM field in mtfsf(.) *must* be in Hex.

SPR field in mfspr/mtspr *must* be in Decimal.

TBR field in mftb *must* be in Decimal.

crF field *must* be in Decimal.

crB field *must* be in Decimal.

BO & BI in standard mnemonic branch instructions *must* be in Decimal.

W, I, and GQR fields in paired single instructions *must* be in Decimal.

TO field in trap instructions *must* be in Decimal.

SR field in Segment Register instructions *must* be in Decimal.

SH field in srawi(.) *must* be in Decimal

n field in rotlwi(.), slwi(.), srwi(.), clrlwi(.), & clrrwi(.) *must* be in Decimal

=============

-Branch-labels-

Branch labels are allowed as long as they meet the following criteria

*The very first PPC instruction of your source *CANNOT* be a branch w/ a branch label
*Use capital letters and/or underscores
*No shorter than 3 characters in length
*No longer than 31 characters in length

Example~
beq SOMEWHERE
...
SOMEWHERE:

============

-Important NOTE regarding mfspr and mtspr simplified mnemonics-

Any valid SPR in the mfspr/mtspr can be used in the following format..
mtNAME rX
mfNAME rX

NAME = the SPR's name ofc

Example:
mtl2cr r11 #Move r11 contents to L2CR
mfhid0 r30 #Move HID0 contents to r30

No other PPC assembler can do this for all the SPRs!

Because this special SPR format is Waltress-unique, you *CANNOT* use the "legacy format" which is valid for some SPRS. For example....
mtibatu 3, r12 #Move r12 contents to IBAT3u

The above instruction *WON'T* work in Waltress. Use the new and improved format instead!
mtibat3u r12 #Better format! Hooray!

============

-Comments-

Comments are indeed supported. You can use standard hash comments and chain comments.

Examples:
nop #Standard comment
nop /*Chain comment*/
/*This
is
a
Chain comment*/

============

NOTE ("noobies" can disregard this note): For the following instructions...

*trap
*bcX with BO of 0b10100
*blr
*blrl
*bctr
*bctrl
*bdnz
*bdz
*bdnzctr
*bdnzctrl
*bdzctr
*bdzctrl
*bdnzlr
*bdnzlrl
*bdzlr
*bdzlrl

...may not re-assemble back to their 100% exact original pre-assembled instruction (Hexadecimal word value) after disassembling from an original code.txt file. This is because these simplified mnemonics have fields and/or register values that qualify as "Don't Care Values". Meaning that these fields/values can be anything and the instruction in question still qualifies as being the simplified mnemonic. When Waltress assembles instructions with these "don't care values", they are set to 0. Please note that all other known PPC Assemblers are "plagued" with this. It's impossible to fix without completely getting rid of the simplified mnemonics.

NOTE: For the bcX, bcctrX, and bclrX instructions, all "don't care" values for the BO field *only* *MUST* be low or else the instruction is treated as illegal (which is what other PPC assemblers do as well).

If the above 2 notes make zero sense to you, then don't worry. They won't effect you.

Final NOTE:

bcX with BO of 0b10100 is an alternative instruction that exactly mimics an unconditional branch. Therefore I've made custom Waltress-unique mnemonics for these 4 rare instructions.

bcX with BO of 0b10100 = bal 0xXXXX (branch always)
bcX with BO of 0b10100 && aa high = bala 0xXXXX (branch always absolute)
bcX with BO of 0b10100 && lk high = ball 0xXXXX (branch always & link)
bcX with BO of 0b10100 && aa && lk high = balla 0xXXXX (branch always absolute & link)

============

FINAL Note (to other coders/devs)

This project (due to its handwritten nature and my lack of fixing code along the way) has a ton of technical debt. Therefore, code optimization may never happen unless someone else is willing to do it.
