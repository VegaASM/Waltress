*WALTRESS*

The first ever PPC Assembler entirely handwritten in PPC! It is 100% Broadway (Wii CPU) compliant. Waltress can also assemble Gecko Codes.

Why the name Waltress? Waltress is one of Daysha's cats, and she is a shy black+brown long hair cat with a gigantic fluffy tail. Waltress is also the site mascot for MarioKartWii.com.

2b: Waltress expects a code.txt file present in /apps/HBC-Waltress-0.6.1 for disassembling. Place code.txt into /apps/HBC-Waltress-0.6 folder.
3: Do NOT have both a source.s and code.txt file present in /apps/HBC-Waltress-0.6.1.
4: SD/USB device out of computer and into your Wii

Using Waltress HBC App (Dolphin)

1. Copy-Paste /HBC-Waltress-0.6.1 folder into the /apps folder of the location of your Virtual SD Card on your computer

5: Waltress will display a Success Message or an Error Message after usage.

Using Waltress Desktop Application (Linux w/ QEMU-PPC)

1. *NOTE* that this has only been confirmed to work on Linux Debian 11. In theory, if you have QEMU-PPC installed on Windows along with a GCC PPC 32-bit Compiler, then you should be able to compile the Source to a Windows-compliant PPC executable. Which can then be launched by QEMU. I do *NOT* own a Windows machine, so I cannot be of help here.
2. Install QEMU-PPC
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install qemu-user qemu-user-static
3. Make sure App is executable
cd DV
chmod +x ./main
4a: Waltress expects a source.s file present in /DV for assembling. Place that file into /DV folder.
4b: Waltress expects a code.txt file present in /DV for disassembling. Place that file into /DV folder.
5: Do NOT have both a source.s and code.txt file present in /DV.
6. Launch the App
./main
7. Follow the on screen instructions.
8: Waltress will display a Success Message or an Error Message after usage.
