*WALTRESS*

The first ever PowerPC Assembler entirely handwritten in PowerPC! It is 100% Broadway (Wii CPU) compliant. Waltress can also assemble Wii Gecko Codes.

Why the name Waltress? Waltress is one of Daysha's cats, and she is a shy black+brown long hair cat with a gigantic fluffy tail. Waltress is also the site mascot for MarioKartWii.com.

Please read over this document to understand the contents of some of the folders and files present in this zip package.
